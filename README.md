# Turtle Graphics Game

## Project Description

This project is a simple turtle graphics-based game. The game sets up a graphical window and seems to be configuring paddles, likely mimicking classic games like Pong.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the Turtle graphics library. You can install the Turtle library using pip:

```bash
pip install PythonTurtle
```

## How to Run

To run the game, simply navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

After running the `main.py` script, a window will appear displaying the game interface.

## Code Examples

Here's a sample snippet from the project that sets up the game window:

```python
import turtle as t

window = t.Screen()
window.bgcolor("black")
window.setup(width=1000, height=700)
```
